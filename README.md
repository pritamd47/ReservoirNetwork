# Reservoir Network - River Regulation due to Reservoir Operations

## Summary
In this project, I had set out to model the river flow regulation due to reservoir operations. Reservoirs (behind dams), usually store water before (and during) the wet season, where there is higher flow in the river, and release water during drier periods. This also depends heavily on the primary use of the reservoirs â€“ either Irrigation, Hydropower or Flood control. The final stage of the project will be to use satellite derived storage change estimates of reservoirs, and modeled natural inflow.
